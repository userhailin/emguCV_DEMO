# notes
In the "bin" directory, there is a compressed file. The source file of this compressed file is larger than 25MB, so direct uploading is not possible. 
Therefore, it has been compressed. Therefore, when readers use it, it is essential to extract it before utilization.

在bin目录下有一个压缩文件，该压缩文件的源文件因为大于25MB，所以无法直接上传，故将其压缩，所以读者在使用时，务必将其解压缩后再使用
